# JusPay-Dashboard

## Project Description
This project, **JusPay-Dashboard**, was created using:
- **Next.js** (version 15.0.1) for the application framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first, responsive styling
- **Material UI** for pre-styled, accessible React components
- **React Context** for Managing app state globally

## Getting Started

First, Install all necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

second, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

## Challenges Faced

1. **Creating a UI with dual side drawers and a centered navigation bar**: Implementing this layout required in-depth research on layout customization using Next.js and Material UI. Various articles and resources were referenced to successfully achieve the design.
2. **Making Fonts & Colors Consistent**: Colors and font sizes were added to the Tailwind config file and used consistently across the app.
3. **Building Reusable Components**: Custom components were developed to enhance reusability, making the codebase more modular and reducing duplication.
4. **Separating Sections for Component Differentiation**: Different sections were created to distinguish components, improving readability and organization of the UI.
